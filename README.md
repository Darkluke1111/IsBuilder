# IsBuilder

IsBuilder is a Minecraftplugin, using the Bukkit API

What it does:
Adds the possibility to make advanced recipes, which need different multiblock structures around the workbench in order to be crafted. It is possible to build your own recipes, using the config.yml and also to use your own multiblock structures by placing them into the data-folder as schematics (read below for instructions).
The plugin is mainly designed for skyblock servers, to make it possible to craft blocks which would not be accessible in vanilla minecraft. The multiblock structures are meant to represent different tech-lvls, through which the player has to evolve in order to craft more valuable blocks.

Instructions how to add secipes and structures are given in the INSTRUCTIONS.TXT
